# Image Placeholders

In a real application, this directory would contain phone images for:

- iPhone 16 Pro (in different colors)
- Samsung Galaxy S25 (in different colors)
- Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (in different colors)

For this demo, we're using image paths that reference these images, but in a production environment, you would replace these with actual image files or use a proper asset hosting service.
